Velvet flowers, a generic name for velvet handicrafts, are also known as velvet birds, palace flowers, and joyful flowers. Generally speaking, velvet flowers refer to fake flowers made from silk velvet. Traditional Chinese velvet flowers are made of silk with extra-fine copper wire as a heart to make long strips of velvet of different sizes, which are then coiled into various styles of flowers for women and children to wear. As an alternative to real flowers, they emerged because of a custom of using flowers as accessories. 

The custom of wearing flowered headdresses appeared in China as early as the Qin Dynasty. According to a large number of excavated objects, it became customary to wear flowered headdresses during the Han Dynasty. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the flower bun was a popular way to decorate women's hair, as depicted in Zhou Fang's painting of Court Ladies Wearing Flowered Headdresses during the Tang dynasty. Because real flowers were expensive, fake flowers like velvet flowers were used instead.

During the Song dynasty, the number of people engaged in the flowered headdresses industry increased, and the Southern Song dynasty had developed the flowered headdress market. The materials used to make fake flowers were various, including gold, silver, silk, yarn, damask, velvet, ricepaper pith, and colored paper. According to historical records, men also wore flowered headdresses during the Song dynasty. Some of them were for auspicious reasons on New Year's Day, and some of them were worn by ministers and emperors at the same time.

In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the custom of flowered headdresses spread from the palace to the public, and the fake flowers were made more exquisitely in the workshops. During this period, flowered headdresses were mostly worn by women, but rarely by men. The exception to this was the custom of flowered headdresses for those who won the imperial examinations.

During the Republican of China era, it was popular for women from wealthy families to have a perm and wear flowered headdresses. Women from ordinary families usually wore long braids, tied with red ropes and decorated with velvet flowers. After the founding of New China, the custom of flowered headdresses gradually disappeared and faded from people's lives due to social changes.
